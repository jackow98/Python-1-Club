### Python 1% Club Coding Challenge

Welcome to the **Python 1% Club!** Inspired by the popular gameshow, this challenge will test your coding skills with questions that get progressively harder. Each question is designed to be answered by fewer and fewer people, starting from questions that 90% of participants can answer, down to the ultimate 1% question. Ready to see if you belong to the top 1%? Letâ€™s get started!

#### Question 1: 90%
**Fix the Loop**
There is an error in the following for loop. Fix it so that it prints numbers from 1 to 5.
```python
for i in range(1, 6)
    print(i)
```

#### Question 2: 80%
**Create an Array**
Create an array with the names of 5 people and print each name.
```python
# Create an array and print each name
```

#### Question 3: 70%
**Simple Calculator**
Write a program that asks the user to input two numbers and then prints their sum.
```python
# Create a simple calculator to add two numbers
```

#### Question 4: 60%
**Even Numbers**
Write a program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20.
```python
# Print all even numbers between 1 and 20
```

#### Question 5: 50%
**Sum of Integers**
Write a program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 100.
```python
# Calculate and print the sum of integers from 1 to 100
```

#### Question 6: 45%
**Palindrome Checker**
Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
```python
# Define a function to check for palindromes
```

#### Question 7: 40%
**Vowel Counter**
Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string.
```python
# Count the number of vowels in a string
```

#### Question 8: 35%
**Simple File Handling**
Write a program that writes "Hello, World!" to a file and then reads the content from the file.
```python
# Write to a file and read from it
```

#### Question 9: 30%
**FizzBuzz**
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
```python
# Implement FizzBuzz logic
```

#### Question 10: 25%
**Prime Numbers**
Write a function that returns a list of prime numbers up to a given number.
```python
# Define a function to generate prime numbers
```

#### Question 11: 20%
**Bubble Sort**
Given the array `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]`, sort the array using the bubble sort algorithm.
```python
# Implement bubble sort on the array
array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
```

#### Question 12: 15%
**Boolean Logic**
Write a program that asks the user for two boolean values (True or False) and prints the result of the AND, OR, and NOT operations on them. Additionally, create a function that takes two boolean values as arguments and creates an array with the results of AND, OR, and NOT.
```python
# Implement boolean logic operations
# Create a function to return results in an array
```

#### Question 13: 10%
**Conditional Loop**
Write a program that keeps asking the user for a number until they enter a negative number. Then print the sum of all entered numbers.
```python
# Implement a loop that continues until a negative number is entered
```

#### Question 14: 5%
**Binary Search**
Implement the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.
```python
# Implement binary search
```

#### Question 15: 1%
**Problem Solving Challenge 1: Two Sum**
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```python
# Example usage:
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

#### Final Challenge: 1%
**Problem Solving Challenge 2: Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
Write a function that finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string. Do not use dictionaries or the `enumerate` function.

Example:
```python
# Example usage:
print(length_of_longest_substring("abcabcbb"))  # Output: 3 ("abc")
```

Good luck, and let's see if you can make it to the 1%!
